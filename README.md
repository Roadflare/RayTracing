# RayTracing

Ray Tracing program written in Rust for the FMF class 'Programiranje 2'.


## Idea
The goal of this project is to implement a ray tracing algorithm capable of rendering all five Platonic solids and a sphere. Additionally, we may extend support for custom meshes to allow more flexibility in the rendering process. The focus is on correctness, efficiency, and learning about ray tracing fundamentals.

Ray tracing is a powerful technique for generating realistic images by simulating how rays of light interact with objects in a scene. The program will calculate intersections between rays and geometric objects, handle shading and lighting effects, and produce rendered images.

The project consists of two main components:

1. Ray tracing implementation – The core algorithm responsible for casting rays, detecting intersections, handling shading, and rendering images.
2. Executable program – A program that utilizes our ray tracing implementation to generate and display images.
